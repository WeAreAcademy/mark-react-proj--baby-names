## Overview

You will make and deploy a single-page React app which will show baby names and let you pick your favourites. The names data is provided for you.

Here's an example screenshot to give you a rough idea, but note that the project text below takes precedence over any details from the image. Also, you are free to lay out and style your project as you see fit.

## Setup

- Create a new React app on your machine called `baby-names-react`. Make sure you set up with TypeScript not the JavaScript default. 
[Guide to React project creation setup (with TypeScript)](https://www.notion.so/weareacademy/How-to-create-a-React-app-with-TypeScript-76643f84db564a69a04db9a0b6a2f2e7)

- Publish the project repo to github. Call it `baby-names-react`.

- Set up continuous deployment of your app to [Netlify](https://netlify.app/) as `academy-yourgithubusername-baby-names`.netlify.app where `yourgithubusername` is your github username. See [Netlify deployment guide for React apps](https://www.notion.so/weareacademy/How-to-deploy-a-React-app-to-free-Netlify-hosting-9e6ebd4dcb814cb483c34eb0f05ea96e)



### Setup - the data:

The data is available in the file [./data/babyNamesData.json](./data/babyNamesData.json).

Copy across this JSON file to your app's `src/` directory, and then import it.

## Exercise 1

- Write a React app which lists baby names from the given file.

- It should display boys' and girls' names differently - it's your choice as to how\*

- The names should be displayed in ascending alphabetical order.

- Your project should be on GitHub and Netlify with correct names.

(\*) Feel very free to break from the the "blue-for-boys/pink-for-girls" stereotyping and style it differently.

## Exercise 2

(Make sure your previous work is all committed to git before commencing this exercise!)

- Add a search bar.

- When the user types into it, your app should update the displayed list of baby names to only show matches.

- Matches should be case-insensitive.

- When the search bar is clear, all names should be shown.

### Note
Don't worry initially about breaking down your solution into multiple cooperating components.  That will add extra complexity.  First, feel free to get the application working with all the logic and state stored in a single component.


## Exercise 3

(Make sure your previous work is all committed to git before commencing this exercise!)

- Check in with faculty before continuing to this level.

- Add a "favourites" list, displayed separately.

- When the user clicks a name from the main list, it should be moved to a "favourites" list. It should disappear from the main list!

- When the user clicks a name from the _favourites_ list, it should be moved back to the main list. It should disappear from the favourites list!

## Exercise 4

(Make sure your previous work is all committed to git before commencing this exercise!)

Add "name gender" filter buttons.

These buttons should allow the user to see only boy names, girl names, or all names.

The buttons should operate as "radio" buttons - exactly one should be active at any time.

The app should start by showing all names.

It should be clear which filter (if any) is in effect at any time.

_How it works with search:_

If there is also a search term in effect, your app should apply the gender filter to those search results.

# Organise into components

If you haven't yet organised the application into components, try to do so now.  This isn't easy, so make sure you've committed your work before you start.


# Ideas for more work

- Find a way to persist the user's favourites even after the browser tab is closed
- Add the ability for the user to shuffle the list of names
- Find an attractive way to differentiate names by gender that doesn't use blue/pink stereotypes.
- Add some suitably-themed sound effects for the UI.
